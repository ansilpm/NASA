Our project transforms two iconic astronaut experiences—the breathtaking views of Earth from the ISS Cupola and the sensation of weightlessness practiced in the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL)—into an interactive educational tool.

Through a gamified app, VR/AR classroom modules, or an educational website, users can:

Explore Earth from space with real ISS imagery and data.

Experience astronaut training by simulating buoyancy and underwater tasks at the NBL.

This project connects space to everyday life by highlighting how astronaut experiences support Earth-based benefits such as disaster monitoring, climate studies, robotics, and healthcare innovations. It aims to inspire students, engage the public, and nurture the next generation of explorers by making space exploration relatable, accessible, and impactful.
